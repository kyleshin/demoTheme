# Theme Demo for iOS
This project demonstrates how to implement a theme for iOS application. 
The example provides three themes- light, dark, and dubs(blue and gold) mode.

The key to making a theme work is to broadcast change of themes to the notification center.
All relevant controllers should be registered to listen to the broadcast. This is also
demonstrated in the example.
